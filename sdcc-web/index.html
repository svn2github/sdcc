      <h2>What is SDCC ?</h2>

      <p> <b>SDCC</b> is a <b><i>Freeware,
retargettable, optimizing ANSI - C compiler</i></b> that
targets the <b><i>Intel 8051, Maxim 80DS390</i></b>
and the<b><i> Zilog Z80 </i></b>based MCUs.
Work is in progress on supporting the Motorola 68HC08 as well as
Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 series. The entire source code for the
compiler is distributed
under GPL. </p>

      <p>Some of the features include: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>ASXXXX and ASLINK, a Freeware, retargettable
assembler and
linker.</li>

        <li>extensive MCU specific language extensions,
allowing effective use of the underlying hardware.</li>

        <li>a host of standard optimizations such as <i>global
sub expression
elimination, loop optimizations (loop invariant, strength reduction of
induction
variables and loop reversing ), constant folding </i>and<i>
propagation,
copy propagation, dead code elimination and jump tables for 'switch'
statements.</i> </li>

        <li>MCU specific optimisations, including a global
register allocator.</li>

        <li>adaptable MCU specific backend that should be well
suited for other 8
bit MCUs</li>

        <li>independent rule based peep hole optimizer.</li>

        <li>a full range of data types: <b>
char </b>(<i>8</i> bits, 1 byte), <b>short </b>(<i>16</i>
bits, 2
bytes), <b>int</b> (<i>16</i> bits, 2 bytes), <b>long
          </b> (<i>32</i> bit, 4
bytes)
and <b>
float </b> (<i>4</i> byte IEEE). </li>

        <li>the ability to add inline assembler code anywhere in
a function.</li>

        <li>the ability to report on the complexity of a function
to help decide what
should be re-written in assembler.</li>

        <li>a good selection of automated regression tests.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>SDCC also comes with the <i>source level debugger</i><b>
SDCDB</b>, using the current version of Daniel's s51 simulator. </p>

      <p> <b>SDCC</b> was written by Sandeep Dutta
and released under a GPL license. Since its
initial release there have been numerous bug fixes and improvements. As
of
December 1999, the code was moved to SourceForge where all the "users
turned
developers" can access the same source tree. SDCC is constantly being
updated
with all the users' and developers' input. </p>

      <p>AVR and gbz80 ports are no longer maintained. </p>

      <p> </p>

places listed below. Here is a short check list of tips to greatly
improve your
chances of obtaining a helpful response. </p>

      <ol>

        <li>Attach the code you are compiling with SDCC. It
should compile "out of the box". Snippets must compile and must include

      <h2>Past news</h2>

      <p><i><b>February 26th, 2004 - SDCC 2.4.0
released</b></i></p>

      <p>Source code and binaries for Mac OS X, Microsoft
Windows, and Linux are available from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=599">Sourceforge
download page</a>. SDCC has been tested on Mandrake 9.2, Windows
98, and Mac OS X with the gcc 3.3 update.</p>

      <p><i><b>September 29, 2001 - Version 2.3.0
released</b></i></p>

      <p>Version 2.3.0 is now available. This is the first
official release in some time, and includes many bug fixes and
significantly improved Z80 support.</p>

      <p><i><b>July 11, 2001 - Winbin updates</b></i></p>

      <p>Recently, Karl Bongers has put together a beta for win32
using pre-built cygwin
and Borland bins. You can download it <a href="ftp://sdcc.sourceforge.net/pub/sdcc/sdcc-2.2.2-7.11.01-winbin.zip">
here</a>.
Remember this is a beta build and will change from time to time.
Updates
will be posted in the <a href="#Download">Download</a>
section as they become available. There will be a link in the <a href="#Download">
Download</a> section for this and all future builds. Please *DO
NOT* email Karl directly
with problems. Any questions or fixes you have can be directed to the
mailing
list, see the link in the <a href="#Support">Support</a>
section below.<br>

      </p>

      <p>If you run a win32 box I recommend installing Karl's
build, if only for the
ease of install. If you are a native Linux user, use the CVS tree.
Completely
remove the old source dir and do a fresh checkout.</p>

      <p>As always, there is lots going on in CVS. There are a
LOT of changes to
the documentation. This has been and always will be a short side of
OSS,
SDCC included. The developers have added a lot of new command line
switches
and made changes to the old ones. The mcs51 header files have been
removed
and replaced with a common one. RTFM and then ask questions. The Z80
port
has been updated as well. Scott has fallen off the face of the earth
and
has not been heard from for a while ;-) We'll hear of his adventures
when
he returns. Meanwhile the PIC port has remained static. Michael has
been
working on an automated build for SDCC. If you download the source
files,
this should help tremendously.</p>

      <p>There are a few bugs left that are keeping the
developers from releasing
v2.2.2. This has been said now for a long time now. You just can't rush
quality ;-) An <i>official</i> release should happen in
the next few months.</p>

      <p>Special thanks to Johan Knol for keeping the ball
rolling while everyone
is working their paying jobs.</p>

      <p><i><b>April 24, 2001 - Notes</b></i></p>

      <p>There has been a <i><b>lot</b></i>
of updates to v2.2.2 CVS lately. v2.2.1
is comparatively old and we recommend you download a binary
build from the <a href="http://www.qsl.net/dl9sec/SDCC_OKR.html">OKR</a>
or update your sources from CVS. Mitja Kukovec has sent the mailing
list
some short instructions on installing Cygwin on a Win32 box, the link
to
the text is in the SUPPORT section.</p>

      <p><i><b>February 20, 2001 - Pic Port</b></i></p>

      <p>Scott has been making great strides on the pic port.
There are a lot of issues
with bringing his work into other branches of SDCC, so you will not see
all
of the features of his port in the avr and mcs51 trees. Scott has been
working
on generating intermediate 'pcode' that will be used for code
optimizations
and linker features. This is a major step and there are bound to be
problems...
on the cutting edge you might get cut every once in a while. This has
not
been implemented in any of the other trees, but if he pulls this off,
you
will see better and more flexible code come out of SDCC. We think it's
just
a matter of time ;-) Tip-o-the-hat to Scott.</p>

      <p>Sandeep's daytime job keeps him from doing as much as he
would like, but
he pops in from time to time with fixes and other contributions.
Everyone
involved with the project has been very active lately, we are a lot
closer
to an <i>official</i> 2.2.2 release. As always, the above
can be had from
cvs. It would be a good idea to do a fresh check-out from cvs rather
than
an update as a LOT of things have changed. Binary builds from recent
cvs
sources can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.qsl.net/dl9sec/SDCC_OKR.html">
OKR</a>
.</p>

      <p><i><b>January 25, 2001 -- SDCC v2.2.2 is
still in CVS</b></i></p>

      <p>Due to numerous additions to SDCC to support the Dallas
DS'390, Version 2.2.2
has been delayed until more bugs are squashed. Kevin and Johan are
working
on them all the time ;-) Lots of help from the user and development
mailing
lists too.</p>

      <p>Some (if not all) of SDCC users will be glad to know
that Scott Dattalo has
been porting SDCC to the 14bit versions of the Microchip PIC
controller.
His port is still in its early stages and needs a lot of work but it
does
compile programs. His code has been committed to cvs on sourceforge and
is
included when you update your cvs directories.</p>

      <p><i><b>SDCC v2.2.1 is out!!! Check it out in
the <a href="#download">download</a> section<br>

      </b></i></p>

      <p>This is a milestone release for the development group.<br>

New stuff includes:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>bug fixes (always bug fixes) </li>

        <li>better support for the Dallas '390, flat memory model
is a lot better than
before, not perfect. </li>

        <li>changes to the assembler </li>

        <li>better documentation </li>

        <li>faster compile times </li>

        <li>and more... </li>

      </ul>

      <p>There are more new command line switches to SDCC.. PAY
ATTENTION! Read the
documentation!</p>

      <p>There have been additions to the SDCC developer team, we
would like to welcome</p>

      <p>Kevin Vigor and Johan Knol<br>

And now... Scott Dattalo<br>
